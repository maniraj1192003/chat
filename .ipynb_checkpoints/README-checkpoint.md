<b>GOALS:</b>

* UPDATE ML MODELS TO INCLUDE CURRENT PRICES

  * RE-RUN MODELS, GENERATE FORECASTS, GENERATE ACCURACY SCORES

>Note: ADDED ML MODEL NOTEBOOKS, DATA COLLECTION NOTEBOOKS, FINANCIAL ANALYSIS NOTEBOOKS FROM PROJECT 2

* Import the necessary libraries, including Streamlit and any others that you might need for generating the investment portfolios (e.g. pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms).

* Create a function that will generate the investment portfolio based on the user's risk tolerance. This function should take the user's risk tolerance and age as input and return a portfolio of investments as output. You can use machine learning algorithms to help generate the portfolio based on historical data and other factors.

* Use the Streamlit library to create a chatbot interface. This can include a chat window for the user to enter their risk tolerance, as well as visualizations or other elements that will help the user understand their investment portfolio.

* Add the portfolio generation function to the chatbot interface, so that when the user enters their risk tolerance & age, the chatbot generates and displays the corresponding investment portfolio.
